The data that is posted is analysis based onw eather data, showcasing the effects of location on weather properties such as humidity and cloudiness

These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations and analysis. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them. Below is an example of the the webpage
